Given a table of bank deposits and withdrawals, return the final balance for each account.

Assumption:

    All the transactions performed for each account are present in the table; no transactions are missing.

SELECT 
account_id,
sum(case when transaction_type='Deposit' then amount ELSE
-amount end) as final_balance
FROM transactions
group by 1;
