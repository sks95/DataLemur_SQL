Visa is trying to analyze its Apply Pay partnership. Calculate the total transaction volume for each merchant where the transaction was performed via Apple Pay.

Output the merchant ID and the total transactions by merchant. For merchants with no Apple Pay transactions, output their total transaction volume as 0.

Display the result in descending order of transaction volume.


------------------------------------------

SELECT merchant_id, 
SUM(case when upper(payment_method) = 'APPLE PAY' then transaction_amount else 0 end) 
as volume 
FROM transactions
group by 1
order by volume desc;
