You are given a table of Facebook posts from users who posted at least twice in 2021. Write a query to find the average number of days (with decimals) between each userâ€™s posts during 2021.

Output the user and the average number of the days they waited between posts.

Assumptions:

    A single user can post several times per day.
    When calculating differences between dates, output the component of the time interval representing days.
        Example output: 5.5 days


with cte AS
(
SELECT user_id,
max(post_date) last_date,
min(post_date) first_date,
count(post_id) total_post
FROM posts
where EXTRACT(year from post_date)=2021
GROUP BY user_id
)
SELECT 
user_id,
ROUND((EXTRACT(DAY FROM (last_date - first_date)) / (total_post-1)),1) AS days_between
from cte
where total_post != 1;
