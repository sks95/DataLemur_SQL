Assume you are given the table below on user transactions. Write a query to obtain the list of customers whose first transaction was valued at $50 or more. Output the number of users.

Clarification:

    Use the transaction_date field to determine which transaction should be labeled as the first for each user.
    Use a specific function (we can't give too much away!) to account for scenarios where a user had multiple transactions on the same day, and one of those was the first.

---------------------------------------------

select count(user_id) as users
FROM
(
SELECT *,
row_number() over(PARTITION BY user_id order by transaction_date) rn
FROM user_transactions
order by user_id, transaction_date
)t
where rn = 1
and spend > 50;
