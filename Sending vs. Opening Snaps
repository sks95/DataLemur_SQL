# Asked in Snapchat

Assume you are given the tables below containing information on Snapchat users, their ages, and their time spent sending and opening snaps. Write a query to obtain a breakdown of the time spent sending vs. opening snaps (as a percentage of total time spent on these activities) for each of the different age groups.

To clarify, you should calculate these percentages:

    time sending / (time sending + time opening)
    time opening / (time sending + time opening)

Output the age bucket and percentage of sending and opening snaps. Round the percentages to 2 decimal places.

Note that to find the percentages, multiply by 100.0 and not 100 to avoid integer division.

with cte as 
(
select b.age_bucket, a.activity_type, sum(a.time_spent)as tot
from activities a join age_breakdown b 
on a.user_id=b.user_id
where a.activity_type<>'chat'
group by b.age_bucket, a.activity_type
order by b.age_bucket, a.activity_type
),
cte2 as
(select age_bucket, activity_type, 
tot,
sum(tot) over(partition by age_bucket) as cum_tot,
round((tot/(sum(tot) over(partition by age_bucket))) *100.0, 2)as main
from cte
)
select
age_bucket,
sum(case when activity_type='send' then main end) as send_perc,
sum(case when activity_type='open' then main end) as open_perc
from cte2
group by age_bucket;
