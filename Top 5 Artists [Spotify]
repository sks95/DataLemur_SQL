Assume there are three Spotify tables containing information about the artists, songs, and music charts. Write a query to determine the top 5 artists whose 
songs appear in the Top 10 of the global_song_rank table the highest number of times. From now on, we'll refer to this ranking number as "song 
appearances".

Output the top 5 artist names in ascending order along with their song appearances ranking (not the number of song appearances, but the rank of who has the 
most appearances). The order of the rank should take precedence.

For example, Ed Sheeran's songs appeared 5 times in Top 10 list of the global song rank table; this is the highest number of appearances, so he is ranked 
1st. Bad Bunny's songs appeared in the list 4, so he comes in at a close 2nd.
