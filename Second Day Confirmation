New TikTok users sign up with their emails and each user receives a text confirmation to activate their account. Assume you are given the below tables about emails and texts.

Write a query to display the ids of the users who did not confirm on the first day of sign-up, but confirmed on the second day.

Assumption:

    action_date is the date when the user activated their account and confirmed their sign-up through the text.

-------------------------------------------------------


select e.user_id
from 
(
SELECT email_id, signup_action,
row_number() over(partition by email_id order by action_date) as rn
FROM texts
)t join emails e on t.email_id = e.email_id
where rn = 2 and signup_action = 'Confirmed';
