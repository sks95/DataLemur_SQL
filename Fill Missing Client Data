When you log in to your retailer client's database, you notice that their product catalog data is full of gaps in the category column. Can you write a SQL query that returns the product catalog with the missing data filled in?

Assumptions

    Each category is mentioned only once in a category column.
    All the products belonging to same category are grouped together.
    The first product from a product group will always have a defined category.
        Meaning that the first item from each category will not have a missing category value.

with cte as
(
SELECT *, 
count(category) over(order by product_id)as cnt 
FROM products
)
select product_id,
first_value(category) over(partition by cnt) as category, name
from cte;
