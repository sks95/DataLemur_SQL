The LinkedIn Creator team is looking for power creators who use their personal profile as a company or influencer page. If someone's LinkedIn page has more followers than the company they work for, we can safely assume that person is a power creator.

Write a query to return the IDs of these LinkedIn power creators in alphabetical order.

Assumption:

    A person can work at multiple companies.

Group by e.personal_profile_id
