UnitedHealth Group has a program called Advocate4Me, which allows members to call an advocate and receive support for their health care needs – whether 
that's behavioural, clinical, well-being, health care financing, benefits, claims or pharmacy help. Calls to the Advocate4Me call centre are categorised, 
but sometimes they can't fit neatly into a category. These uncategorised calls are labelled “n/a”, or are just empty (when a support agent enters nothing 
into the category field).

Write a query to find the percentage of calls that cannot be categorised. Round your answer to 1 decimal place.

SELECT 
ROUND(100.0 *
  SUM
  (
    CASE WHEN CALL_CATEGORY IS NULL OR CALL_CATEGORY = 'n/a'
    THEN 1
    ELSE 0
    END
  ) / COUNT(*) ,1
) AS CALL_PERCENTAGE
FROM callers;
