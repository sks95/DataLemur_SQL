UnitedHealth has a program called Advocate4Me, which allows members to call an advocate and receive support for their health care needs â€“ whether that's
behavioural, clinical, well-being, health care financing, benefits, claims or pharmacy help.

Write a query to find how many UHG members made 3 or more calls. case_id column uniquely identifies each call made.
