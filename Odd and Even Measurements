Assume you are given the table below containing measurement values obtained from a sensor over several days. Measurements are taken several times within a given day.
Write a query to obtain the sum of the odd-numbered and even-numbered measurements on a particular day, in two different columns.
Note that the 1st, 3rd, 5th measurements within a day are considered odd-numbered measurements and the 2nd, 4th, 6th measurements are even-numbered measurements.

with cte AS
(
SELECT *,measurement_time::date as measurement_day,
row_number() over(partition by EXTRACT(day from measurement_time) 
order by measurement_time)rn 
FROM measurements
order by measurement_time
)
select measurement_day,
sum(case when rn%2 = '1' then measurement_value else 0 end) as odd_sum,
sum(case when rn%2 = '0' then measurement_value else 0 end) as even_sum
from cte
group by measurement_day
order by measurement_day;
