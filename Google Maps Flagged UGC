As a Data Analyst on the Google Maps User Generated Content team, you and your Product Manager are investigating user-generated content (UGC)â€“ photos and reviews that independent users upload to Google Maps.

Write a query to determine which type of place (place_category) attracts the most UGC tagged as "off-topic". In the case of a tie, show the output in ascending order of place_category.

Assumptions:

    Some places may not have any tags.
    Each UGC upload with the "off-topic" tag will be counted separately.

----------------------------------------------

select place_category as off_topic_places
from
(
SELECT place_id, count(place_id) 
FROM maps_ugc_review
where content_tag='Off-topic'
group by place_id
order by 2 desc limit 2
)t JOIN place_info p
on p.place_id = t.place_id
order by 1;
