The LinkedIn Creator team is looking for power creators who use their personal profile as a company or influencer page. If someone's LinkedIn page has more followers than the company they work for, we can safely assume that person is a power creator.

Write a query to return the IDs of these LinkedIn power creators ordered by the IDs.

Assumption:

    Each person with a LinkedIn profile in this database works at one company only.

-------------------------------------------

select p.profile_id
from personal_profiles p join company_pages c 
on p.employer_id = c.company_id
where p.followers > c.followers
order by 1;
